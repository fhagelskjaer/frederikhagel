My name is Frederik Hagelskjaer. I'm a PostDoc at (SDU) University of Southern Denmark.

My main interests are computer vision and deep learning. I work with both 2D and point cloud data, and my main interest is pose estimation. However, I also work with many other data processing methods.

I am currently looking for different ways to process very large point cloud data using neural networks. I you have any interesting ideas just contact me.

Here are some images from different projects I have worked with:
